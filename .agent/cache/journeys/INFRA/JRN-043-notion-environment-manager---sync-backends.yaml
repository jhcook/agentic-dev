actor: developer using agent CLI
description: Integrate Notion synchronization into the core `agent sync` command,
  allowing users to synchronize their environments with Notion databases using a unified
  CLI experience. The integration should support a `--backend` flag to specify Notion
  as the backend, a `--force` flag to overwrite local or remote state, and coexistence
  with other backends. Additionally, the `agent sync janitor` command should also
  support the `--backend` flag for Notion.
