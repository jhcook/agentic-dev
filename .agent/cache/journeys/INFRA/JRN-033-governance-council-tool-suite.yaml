description: 'The Voice Agent currently lacks specific tools to perform the duties
  of the Governance Council roles. It effectively has no "hands" to manipulate the
  codebase or verify compliance, forcing it to hallucinate responses or fail.

  This Runbook defines the implementation of a **Modular Tool Suite** mapping to the
  10 Governance Roles (Architect, QA, Security, etc.), enabling the agent to act as
  a true proxy for the council.'
