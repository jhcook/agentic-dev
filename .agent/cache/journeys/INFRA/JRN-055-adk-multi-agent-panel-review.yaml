title: ADK Multi-Agent Panel Review
state: DRAFT
schema_version: 1
priority: high
tags:
- infra
- governance
- adk
- multi-agent
actor: developer running governance panel
description: 'Replace the sequential-prompt governance panel with an ADK multi-agent
  system. Each role becomes an LlmAgent with tools, delegation, and loop capabilities.
  A CoordinatorAgent orchestrates parallel role reviews and produces the final verdict.
  The existing AIService is used as the model backend for vendor agnosticism.'
preconditions:
- Agent CLI is installed and configured
- google-adk optional dependency is installed
- Developer has staged changes
auth_context:
  level: authenticated
  permissions: []
steps:
- id: 1
  action: 'Developer sets `council.engine: adk` in config'
  system_response: Configuration is updated to use ADK panel
  assertions:
  - Config validates the engine value (adk or legacy)
- id: 2
  action: Developer runs `agent preflight`
  system_response: ADK CoordinatorAgent delegates to role agents in parallel
  assertions:
  - Each relevant role is instantiated as an LlmAgent
  - Role agents use tools (read_file, search_codebase, list_adrs, check_test_coverage)
  - Irrelevant roles are skipped per existing _filter_relevant_roles logic
- id: 3
  action: Architect agent identifies a dependency concern
  system_response: Architect delegates to Security agent for deeper analysis
  assertions:
  - Delegation produces a sub-finding attached to the Architect's review
  - Security agent uses search_codebase tool to investigate
- id: 4
  action: QA agent finds ambiguous test coverage
  system_response: QA agent loops (max 3 iterations) to refine analysis
  assertions:
  - Loop uses check_test_coverage tool to verify assertions
  - Loop terminates when verdict is conclusive or max iterations reached
- id: 5
  action: CoordinatorAgent collects all role verdicts
  system_response: Final verdict produced in VERDICT/SUMMARY/FINDINGS/REQUIRED_CHANGES
    format
  assertions:
  - Any BLOCK from a role agent means overall BLOCK
  - Output is structurally identical to legacy panel output
- id: 6
  action: Developer runs `agent panel` in consultative mode
  system_response: ADK panel runs in advisory mode (BLOCK verdicts ignored)
  assertions:
  - Consultative mode is supported with ADK engine
  - Findings are collected verbatim without enforcing verdicts
error_paths:
- trigger_step: 2
  condition: google-adk not installed
  system_response: Falls back to legacy sequential panel with warning
  assertions:
  - Warning indicates ADK is not available
  - Legacy panel produces identical output format
  severity: expected
- trigger_step: 2
  condition: ADK orchestration fails mid-review
  system_response: Falls back to legacy panel for remaining roles
  assertions:
  - Partial ADK results are preserved
  - Error is logged to governance log
  severity: expected
edge_cases:
- scenario: All roles are filtered out (no relevant roles for changeset)
  expected: CoordinatorAgent returns PASS with no findings
  severity: warning
- scenario: Model provider is GitHub CLI (synchronous, no async)
  expected: AIService adapter handles sync provider within ADK async loop
  severity: warning
