description: Develop an interactive "fix" mode for the `agent preflight` command to help developers resolve errors more efficiently.
  When preflight checks fail, the tool will identify blockers, propose specific AI-generated fixes, allow developers to apply
  and verify fixes in real-time, and ensure human oversight before any automated changes are finalized.
preconditions:
- Agent CLI is installed and configured
- Developer is in a project directory with .agent/ initialized

  system_response: CLI processes the preflight request
  assertions:
  - Command exits with status 0
  - Expected output displayed
- id: 2
  action: Developer runs `agent preflight --interactive`
  system_response: CLI processes the --interactive request
  assertions:
  - Command exits with status 0
  - Expected output displayed
error_paths:
- trigger_step: 1
  condition: Missing configuration or prerequisites
  system_response: CLI displays clear error with remediation steps
  assertions:
  - Error message is actionable
  severity: expected
edge_cases:
- scenario: Command run with no network access
  expected: Graceful degradation or clear offline error
  severity: warning
