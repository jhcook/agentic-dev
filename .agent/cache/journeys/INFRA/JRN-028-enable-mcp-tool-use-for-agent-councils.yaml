actor: developer using agent CLI
description: This task aims to enhance the intelligence and functionality of Agent Councils (e.g., Preflight Council, Governance
  Panel) by enabling them to autonomously leverage MCP tools like `github:get_issue` or `filesystem:read_file`. This capability
  will allow the agents to perform deeper, context-aware analysis by dynamically interacting with the environment, rather
  than relying solely on static git diffs. It ensures the agents can engage in a "Reason -> Act -> Observe" loop to generate
  more accurate r
preconditions:
- Agent CLI is installed and configured
- Developer is in a project directory with .agent/ initialized
auth_context:
  level: public
  permissions: []
steps:
- id: 1
  action: Developer runs `agent panel`
  system_response: CLI processes the panel request
  assertions:
  - Command exits with status 0
  - Expected output displayed
error_paths:
- trigger_step: 1
  condition: Missing configuration or prerequisites
  system_response: CLI displays clear error with remediation steps
  assertions:
  - Error message is actionable
  severity: expected
edge_cases:
- scenario: Command run with no network access
  expected: Graceful degradation or clear offline error
  severity: warning
