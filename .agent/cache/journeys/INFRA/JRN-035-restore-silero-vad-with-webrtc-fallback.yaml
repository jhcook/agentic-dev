description: Implement a hybrid Voice Activity Detection (VAD) strategy, prioritizing
  Silero VAD for improved accuracy and noise resistance, while providing a seamless
  fallback to WebRTC VAD in cases where Silero initialization fails due to missing
  dependencies, model integrity issues, or download failures.
preconditions:
- Agent CLI is installed and configured
- Developer is in a project directory with .agent/ initialized
auth_context:
  level: public
  permissions: []
steps:
- id: 1
  action: Developer starts voice session via WebSocket or admin console
  system_response: Voice agent initializes STT/TTS pipeline
  assertions:
  - WebSocket connection established
  - Audio pipeline ready
- id: 2
  action: Developer speaks a command or question
  system_response: System transcribes speech, processes intent, generates response
  assertions:
  - Transcription is accurate
  - Response is relevant
- id: 3
  action: Developer receives spoken response
  system_response: TTS converts response to speech, streams audio back
  assertions:
  - Audio plays clearly
  - Latency is acceptable
error_paths:
- trigger_step: 1
  condition: Missing configuration or prerequisites
  system_response: CLI displays clear error with remediation steps
  assertions:
  - Error message is actionable
  severity: expected
edge_cases:
- scenario: Command run with no network access
  expected: Graceful degradation or clear offline error
  severity: warning
