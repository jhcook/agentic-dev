description: Develop a cost-effective integration for GitHub repository, issue, and pull request management by implementing
  a GitHub MCP (Model Context Protocol) client in the `agent` software. Leverage the user's existing Personal Access Token
  (PAT) without requiring an expensive GitHub Copilot Pro+ subscription. Ensure secure secret management, robust error handling,
  and compatibility with the `npx` runtime.
preconditions:
- Agent CLI is installed and configured
- Developer is in a project directory with .agent/ initialized
auth_context:
  level: authenticated
  permissions: []
steps:
- id: 1
  action: Developer runs `agent mcp run`
  system_response: CLI processes the run request
  assertions:
  - Command exits with status 0
  - Expected output displayed
- id: 2
  action: Developer runs `agent mcp run github list_repositories`
  system_response: CLI processes the list_repositories request
  assertions:
  - Command exits with status 0
  - Expected output displayed
- id: 3
  action: Developer runs `agent mcp start`
  system_response: CLI processes the start request
  assertions:
  - Command exits with status 0
  - Expected output displayed
- id: 4
  action: Developer runs `agent mcp start github`
  system_response: CLI processes the github request
  assertions:
  - Command exits with status 0
  - Expected output displayed
- id: 5
  action: Developer runs `agent secret`
  system_response: CLI processes the secret request
  assertions:
  - Command exits with status 0
  - Expected output displayed
error_paths:
- trigger_step: 1
  condition: Missing configuration or prerequisites
  system_response: CLI displays clear error with remediation steps
  assertions:
  - Error message is actionable
  severity: expected
edge_cases:
- scenario: Command run with no network access
  expected: Graceful degradation or clear offline error
  severity: warning
