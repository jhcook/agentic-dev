description: >
  End-to-end PR creation workflow. Developer runs `agent pr` to run preflight,
  generate PR title and body, and invoke `gh pr create`. Encapsulates the
  full /pr workflow in a single CLI command.
preconditions:
- Agent CLI is installed and configured
- Developer is on a feature branch with commits
- gh CLI is installed and authenticated
auth_context:
  level: authenticated
  permissions: []
steps:
- id: 1
  action: Developer runs `agent pr`
  system_response: CLI runs `agent preflight --ai` as prerequisite
  assertions:
  - Preflight checks execute automatically
  - BLOCK verdict prevents PR creation
  - PASS verdict allows PR to proceed
- id: 2
  action: System generates PR metadata
  system_response: CLI auto-generates title and body from story and commits
  assertions:
  - Title follows [STORY-ID] description format
  - Body includes Story Link, Changes summary, and Governance status

  action: System creates PR via GitHub CLI
  system_response: CLI invokes `gh pr create` with generated title and body
  assertions:
  - PR is created successfully
  - PR URL is displayed to the developer
error_paths:
- trigger_step: 1
  condition: Preflight returns BLOCK
  system_response: CLI displays preflight failures and aborts PR creation
  assertions:
  - Error message includes specific BLOCK reasons
  severity: expected
- trigger_step: 3
  condition: gh CLI not installed
  system_response: CLI reports gh is missing with installation instructions
  assertions:
  - Error is actionable
  severity: expected
edge_cases:

  expected: Preflight is skipped, PR is created directly
  severity: warning
