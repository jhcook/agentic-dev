description: Build a robust, stateful `AgentExecutor` engine that enables "ReAct" (Reason + Act) loops. This decouples the
  agent's cognitive cycle (Thinking -> Tool Call -> Observation) from the stateless `AIService`. It provides the foundational
  "Brain" needed for Council agents to using tools securely and effectively.
preconditions:
- Agent CLI is installed and configured
- Developer is in a project directory with .agent/ initialized

  action: Developer starts admin console with `agent admin start`
  system_response: Frontend (5173) and backend (8000) start
  assertions:
  - Console is accessible at http://localhost:5173
- id: 2

  system_response: UI renders Implement ReAct Agent Loop Engine view
  assertions:
  - View loads without errors
  - Data is displayed correctly
