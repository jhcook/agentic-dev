description: Implement a safe and secure secret rotation mechanism for the Agent CLI,
  preventing accidental data loss during re-initialization and allowing users to change
  their master password without losing access to their stored credentials.
preconditions:
- Agent CLI is installed and configured
- Developer is in a project directory with .agent/ initialized
auth_context:
  level: authenticated
  permissions: []
steps:
- id: 1
  action: Developer runs `agent secret init`
  system_response: CLI processes the init request
  assertions:
  - Command exits with status 0
  - Expected output displayed
- id: 2
  action: Developer runs `agent secret rotate-key`
  system_response: CLI processes the rotate-key request
  assertions:
  - Command exits with status 0
  - Expected output displayed
error_paths:
- trigger_step: 1
  condition: Missing configuration or prerequisites
  system_response: CLI displays clear error with remediation steps
  assertions:
  - Error message is actionable
  severity: expected
edge_cases:
- scenario: Command run with no network access
  expected: Graceful degradation or clear offline error
  severity: warning
