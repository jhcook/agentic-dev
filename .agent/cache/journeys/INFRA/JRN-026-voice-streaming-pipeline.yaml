description: Refactor the voice processing pipeline to support real-time streaming
  with natural prosody. This involves moving from a request/response model to an asynchronous
  generator pipeline (`Agent -> SentenceBuffer -> TTS -> Audio Stream`) to drive the
  local `Kokoro` TTS (and cloud providers) efficiently.
preconditions:
- Agent CLI is installed and configured
- Developer is in a project directory with .agent/ initialized
auth_context:
  level: authenticated
  permissions: []
steps:
- id: 1
  action: Developer starts voice session via WebSocket or admin console
  system_response: Voice agent initializes STT/TTS pipeline
  assertions:
  - WebSocket connection established
  - Audio pipeline ready
- id: 2
  action: Developer speaks a command or question
  system_response: System transcribes speech, processes intent, generates response
  assertions:
  - Transcription is accurate
  - Response is relevant
- id: 3
  action: Developer receives spoken response
  system_response: TTS converts response to speech, streams audio back
  assertions:
  - Audio plays clearly
  - Latency is acceptable
error_paths:
- trigger_step: 1
  condition: Missing configuration or prerequisites
  system_response: CLI displays clear error with remediation steps
  assertions:
  - Error message is actionable
  severity: expected
edge_cases:
- scenario: Command run with no network access
  expected: Graceful degradation or clear offline error
  severity: warning
