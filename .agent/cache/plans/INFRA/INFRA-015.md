- [INFRA-016: Implement Agent Visualize](file:////Users/jcook/repo/agentic-dev/.agent/cache/stories/INFRA/INFRA-016-implement-agent-visualize.md)
- [INFRA-017: Implement Agent Query](file:////Users/jcook/repo/agentic-dev/.agent/cache/stories/INFRA/INFRA-017-implement-agent-query.md)

## Summary
The goal is to reduce friction for new developers and provide powerful tools for understanding the codebase.

## Objectives
- **Onboarding**: Create an interactive `agent onboard` command to setup environments.
- **Visualization**: Create `agent visualize` to generate architecture diagrams.
- **Knowledge Base**: Create `agent query` for RAG-based context retrieval.

## Verification
- **Code Review**: Pass preflight.
- **Manual Testing**: Verify commands work as expected in fresh and existing environments.
