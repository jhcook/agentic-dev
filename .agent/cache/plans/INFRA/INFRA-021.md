## Child Stories
- [INFRA-021: Implement Agent Refactor](file:////Users/jcook/repo/agentic-dev/.agent/cache/stories/INFRA/INFRA-021-implement-agent-refactor.md)
- [INFRA-022: Implement Agent Test-Gen](file:////Users/jcook/repo/agentic-dev/.agent/cache/stories/INFRA/INFRA-022-implement-agent-test-gen.md)

## Summary
The goal is to use the agent not just for reactive tasks but for proactive codebase maintenance.

## Objectives
- **Refactoring**: Analyze code complexity and propose refactoring plans.
- **Test Generation**: Analyze coverage and generate unit tests for gaps.

## Verification
- **Code Review**: Pass preflight.
- **Manual Testing**: Run analysis on complex modules and verify generated tests pass.
