# License Header Enforcement

## Rule

All source code files (Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, CSS, Shell) MUST contain the standard Apache 2.0 license header.

## Instructions

- All new or modified source code files must include the license preamble.
- Using the `add_license` tool is the preferred way to add this header.
- Files without a header must be flagged as BLOCK in the `@Docs` review.

## 📝 Output Formatting

When generating your findings and listing necessary modifications in the `REQUIRED_CHANGES` section, you **MUST** include a `(Source: <filepath or ADR>)` citation for each item to prove the change is grounded in actual codebase context and policy.

Example:
```
REQUIRED_CHANGES:
- change 1 (Source: path/to/file.py): Details of the change.
```
