# License Header Enforcement

## Rule

All source code files (Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, CSS, Shell) MUST contain the standard Apache 2.0 license header.

## Instructions

- All new or modified source code files must include the license preamble.
- Using the `add_license` tool is the preferred way to add this header.
- Files without a header must be flagged as BLOCK in the `@Docs` review.
