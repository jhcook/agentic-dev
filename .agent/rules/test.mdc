# Testing Rules

## Web (Next.js)
- **Unit Testing**: Use **Jest** (`npm run test`).
- **E2E Testing**: Use **Playwright** (`npm run e2e:headless`).
- **Snapshot Testing**: Use Storybook interactions where appropriate.

## Mobile (Expo)
- **Unit Testing**: Use **Jest-Expo** (`npm run test`).
- **UI Testing**: Use **Maestro** (if configured) or Detox.

## Backend (FastAPI)
- **Unit & Integration**: Use **Pytest** (`pytest`).
- **Async**: Ensure `pytest-asyncio` is used for async endpoints.
- **Coverage**: Aim for high coverage on core business logic.

## General
- Always create and update tests applicable to the code.
- Run tests locally before pushing (`npm test` or `pytest`).
