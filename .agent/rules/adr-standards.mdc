# ADR Standards

All ADRs in this repository must follow these rules:

1. **Immutability of Logic**: Once an ADR is "Accepted", its core decision logic should not change without a new ADR superseding it.
2. **Change Logging**: If minor updates or clarifications are made to an existing ADR, you **MUST** add a `## Changes` section at the bottom of the file.
    - The section should list changes in **descending chronological order** (most recent first).
    - Format: `- **YYYY-MM-DD**: <Description of change>`

3. **Compliance & Validation**:
## Status Definitions

*   **DRAFT**: Decision is being written.
*   **PROPOSED**: Decision is under discussion.
*   **ACCEPTED**: Decision is agreed upon and binding.
*   **SUPERSEDED**: Decision has been replaced by a newer ADR.
*   **DEPRECATED**: Decision is still technically authoritative but discouraged.
    *   **Rule**: MAY NOT be referenced by NEW Plans/Stories.
    *   **Rule**: EXISTING usage is permitted but should optionally be migrated.
*   **RETIRED**: Decision is no longer in use.
    *   **Rule**: MUST NOT be referenced by ANY Plan/Story.
    *   **Rule**: EXISTING usage MUST be removed.
    - **Linkage**: Any Pull Request or Commit that implements or modifies architecture MUST explicitly link to the relevant ADR (e.g., "Implements ADR-014").
    - **Evidence**: Provide evidence in the PR description that the changes align with the ADR's decision logic.
    - **Updates**: If the implementation requires deviating from the ADR, the ADR MUST be updated *before* the code is merged.
