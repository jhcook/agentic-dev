# No Stubs Policy

When requested to implement a feature, system, or fallback, you must **NEVER create stubs** or placeholders under the assumption that the capability is "mocked" for later.

1. **Complete End-to-End Solutions**: Always write functional, complete code that implements the requested behavior.
2. **User Trust**: Creating stubs is considered an anti-pattern as it leaves the user believing capabilities exist that do not.
3. **No "TODO" Implementations**: Do not leave `pass`, `raise NotImplementedError`, or `TODO:` blocks in place of core logic unless explicitly instructed by the user as part of a phased rollout.
4. **Verification**: Always include functional tests (unit or integration) that prove the implementation works end-to-end, rather than just asserting that a function exists.
