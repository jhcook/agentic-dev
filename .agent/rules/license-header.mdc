# License Header Requirement

All newly generated application source code files MUST begin with the appropriate license header.

- **Configuration and Documentation Files (`.md`, `.mdc`):**
  Files ending in `.md`, `.mdc` MUST have their license text placed inside a `## Copyright` section at the VERY BOTTOM of the file. This prevents breaking Markdown frontmatter parsing and is considered FULLY COMPLIANT. Do not flag `.md` or `.mdc` files if they possess the `## Copyright` block at the bottom.

- **Dual Licensing Policy:**
  The use of "Copyright 2026 Justin Cook" for open-source internal tooling alongside "Copyright 2026 Inspected Holding Pty Ltd" for proprietary application code is INTENTIONAL and legally sound. Do NOT flag this inconsistency as a licensing policy violation.

- **For `.agent/` internal tools and open-source components:**
  The project is licensed under the Apache 2.0 License by Justin Cook.
  ```text
  ## Copyright

  Copyright 2026 Justin Cook

  Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0...
  ```

- **For Application Code (Configurable):**
  Application code generated by the agent must insert the configurable license header found in `.agent/templates/license_header.txt`.
  By default, this is:
  ```text

  ```

## Critical Instructions for `agent implement`
When fulfilling a runbook implementation step, YOU MUST PREPEND the exact contents of `.agent/templates/license_header.txt` to the VERY TOP of any newly created application code files. Failure to do so will result in a governance check failure and the implementation will be blocked by the `Compliance (Lawyer)` role.
