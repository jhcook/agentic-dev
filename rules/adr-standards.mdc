# ADR Standards

All ADRs in this repository must follow these rules:

1. **Immutability of Logic**: Once an ADR is "Accepted", its core decision logic should not change without a new ADR superseding it.
2. **Change Logging**: If minor updates or clarifications are made to an existing ADR, you **MUST** add a `## Changes` section at the bottom of the file.
    - The section should list changes in **descending chronological order** (most recent first).
    - Format: `- **YYYY-MM-DD**: <Description of change>`
