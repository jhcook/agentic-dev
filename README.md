# Agent CLI - AI-Powered Governance Framework

> **Governance by Code**: Enforce architectural standards, compliance (SOC2/GDPR), and quality assurance through an intelligent CLI that acts as your development team's governance layer.

## 🚀 Overview

**Agent** is an AI-powered CLI tool that automates governance, compliance, and quality checks for software development teams. Think of it as your **virtual governance team** that:

- ✅ **Reviews code** for architecture violations
- ✅ **Enforces compliance** (GDPR, SOC2)
- ✅ **Validates test coverage** and documentation
- ✅ **Generates implementation plans** and runbooks
- ✅ **Automates preflight checks** before commits

## 🛑 Validation vs 💡 Consultation

The Agent supports two modes of governance review:

### 1. Preflight (The Gatekeeper)
**Command**: `agent preflight --ai`
- **Role**: Strict auditor.
- **Goal**: Validation before merge/deploy.
- **Outcome**: `PASS` or `BLOCK` (Exit code 1 on failure).
- **Use When**: You are ready to commit or create a PR.

### 2. Panel (The Expert Council)
**Command**: `agent panel` (or via workflow)
- **Role**: Expert consultants (Architect, Security, QA).
- **Goal**: Advice, warnings, and design feedback.
- **Outcome**: Friendly advice (Always exit code 0).
- **Use When**: You are designing, prototyping, or stuck.
