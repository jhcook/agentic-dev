# Agentic Voice Backend

This repository contains the backend services for the Agentic Voice application.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

## Agent Management Console

Start the visual dashboard (Frontend + Backend) with a single command:

```bash
agent admin start
```

This launches:

- **Backend API**: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- **Frontend UI**: `http://127.0.0.1:8080`

The frontend is configured to proxy API requests to the backend automatically.

> **Note**: The frontend source code is located in `.agent/web/`.
